## Usage

Install the cookiecutter package:

```shell
pip install cookiecutter black isort
```

**Note**: `Black` and `isort` are used to format your project right after it has been generated.

Now run it against this repo:

```shell
cookiecutter https://github.com/Tobi-De/cookiecutter-fastapi
```
You'll be prompted for some values. Provide them, then a fastapi project will be created for you.

You could also use [cruft](https://github.com/cruft/cruft) to be able to keep your project up to date with the latest changes:

```shell
pip install cruft
cruft create https://github.com/Tobi-De/cookiecutter-fastapi
```
It work pretty much the same way as cookiecutter but you'll be able to update your project with the latest changes by running `cruft update`.
